A template is a simple yet very powerful tool in C++. The simple idea is to pass data type as a parameter so that we don’t need to write the same code for different data types. For example, a software company may need to sort() for different data types. Rather than writing and maintaining multiple codes, we can write one sort() and pass data type as a parameter. 
C++ adds two new keywords to support templates: ‘template’ and ‘typename’. The second keyword can always be replaced by the keyword ‘class’.
